# 🚗 VicRoads Fatalities
## 🏁 Project Background
VicRoads is a government agency which manages the road network, motor registration, and ensuring safe and efficient transport systems. In addition to road management, VicRoads is also responsible for promoting road safety. Under Lyra Technologies, our goal was twofold:
1. to gather insights about which driver and vehicle profiles would be more likely to be involved in fatal accidents, and
2. to create a predictive model for whether a certain accident, given the location, vehicle, and driver data would be fatal, meaning at least one person died as a result of the accident.

## 📈 Executive Summary
The top 10 most important variables in determining whether an accident was fatal or not are:
1. Degree of urbanisation
2. Police attendence 
3. Vehicle towed away
4. Vehicle level of damage
5. Vehicle make
6. Accident type
7. Vehicle type
8. Speed zone
9. Caught fire
10. DCA code

The xGBoost model had the best model performance and yielded an AUC of 0.9508. The model was trained on _____ datapoints with _____ variables.
